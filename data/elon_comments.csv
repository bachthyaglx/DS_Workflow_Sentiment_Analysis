@Raj-wf6ln," CanadaCommunity Org  I disagree. with this fellow in the video. He's superimposing assumption of the Mars face as a sign of past civilizations and of  nuclear explosions as caused by nuclear weapons. Earth also has radioactive meteor impact sites. The man who gave this speech worked on the NASA team studying Mars via university. He published a paper about it citing the nuclear explosions as weapons. That he did it for the defense department is quite questionable. They may have examined the evidence after he published his papers. Often comets and asteroids explode and spew toxins, radioactive materials and all have signatures. He has credentials but based an opinion on measurable facts. These facts do not support his source assumption. radioactive materials come from many sources. We have sites in the Mideast and Africa that have similar ""atomic blasts"" caused by meteors.- Here's an example, there is a a layer of ash sediment that contained iridium from meteoric impacts triggering volcanos.. Another layer of ash deposited 13000 years ago contained platinum caused by a meteor or series of meteors that quite likely became an extinction level event and flooding.. Graham Hancock argued against Clovis First as the principle evolution of society in the Americas. The platinum evidence is now being supported as an extinction level event. So Clovis First might be dropped as a theory because of this but biased research for many decades.In this video he's making a good living on the pseudoscience circuit with bombs on Mars",3 years ago,

He keeps saying you can have any number of layers of tunnels. But if you have ten layers of tunnels can you safely dig more under them? At what depth does one tunnel not impact the one above it? What kind of reinforcements are required to compensate for things like wet/sandy soil. Or what happens when you run into the inevitable water tables? Gas pockets, oil fields? What about sinkholes?  I love Elon's ideas but I think they reason they haven't been implemented until now is because it assumes a sort of ""consistency"" to the ground that is being tunneled that is quite frankly ignoring the fundamental inconsistency of the Earth's surface. I think he needs a team of geologists to address some of these problems before dumping $300 billion into a project that would only wind up being a swiss cheese of unfinished tunnels.",5 years ago,

@adamschaeffer1436," @adamschaeffer1436  well he said that a tunnel that is currently built needs to be able to withstand the water table and by achieving that your inherently able to be a vacuum as the water table is 5-6 atmospheres whereas a vucuum or near vacuum is only 1 atmosphere, he has stated before hand that the tunnels are earthquake proof which is part of the reason they chose la, there are hundreds of tunnels already built in cities all over the world, he hasn't just sat down and said I'm going to build tunnels and see if it works even in la he's been given permission for a test tunnel. On the subject of if one blows open in a vacuum do you think they will just be down there running around blindly or have sensors warning systems maintenance etc ? Do you ask the same questions about the subway or trains in general or do you just accept it works because it's done so for longer than you or I have been alive, innovation is hard work and expensive it doesn't happen over night and one man doesn't have all the answers but he's one of a few people that are actively trying to improve peoples lives and continue the species go bang on bp's CEO and ask him what his plans are",5 years ago,

@britthill-noprodonwant6789,"Jared  ""...they didn't know he was receiving ~4.9 billion USD in government subsidies."" Although he ""wasn't"" - if you do combine the credits that his customers ""will"" get, with the tax deferrals that his companies are ""expected"" to get over the next 20 years, he should reach the $5 billion.Right now, his companies employ over 50,000 and he has over 350,000 customers, so if you combine that with the investments he talked about in just the next 10 years in this video its not much per transaction nor for the total gain. And that is not even being able to imagine the scale of the plans for the 10 (20 total) years after that.I worked with a company that built a major building in downtown Los Angeles in the 1980s. There was an old rail tunnel could have been accessed through the underground parking facility. When the Architects and builders asked the the city what they wanted to do, the city said there was no use planned for the tunnels so they could be sealed up. Perhaps you don't want an Elon Musk to solve anything on 'your "" behalf, but ""someone"" with a vision of using resources in the most viable ways overall, would be quite helpful.",5 years ago,
@sonofChrist9682," @PicturesqueGames  He doesnt have time to be an autocratic ruler (yet).        ""So, but but mmmaybe when the tunnels are, you know, are are finished, and then that extra 3% of time can be devoted to the idea of of, of sort of just building a second story of macroplasmic gases onto the sun. Think think of it as simply adding an upstairs floor to a house. Actually its quite similiar and we've already, sort of, drawn up the first set of, of blueprints. No permits though. No one will will look at our applications. So we figured out that if you made the sun twice a big then it will take us two years to, to get around it instead of one. So a day will take 48 hours and we'll live twice as long. So the idea is, if we finish the project in 5 years time, it will actually be completed 3 and 1/2 years and we will live till we are roughly 150 years old.

The general rule of thumb is one tunnel per geologic strata, when they cross each other horizontally. Also there are serious requirements about how fractured the stata can be in order to accomplish a safe tunelling practice. Too fractured it is, and even concrete won't help much against water pressure. By talking about 5 atm water pressure,  tunnels can be built around initial water level +50 m so max. 70-80m depth, closer to 50 near the ocean.",5 years ago,

(and I wasnt even directing it to musk, just that people with dyslexia do this) - if you are in education then you do know how big of a deal it is to detect dyslexia (I didnt get tested for it til I went college at 16), If your first instinct from seeing this form of dyslexia symptom is that that person is bullshitting then I dont know what to say and I am worried about the education system.",5 years ago,2

@jjmonns," @jjmonns  dude stop quoting einstein without knowing about the character of the person you are quoting ... einstein doesnt think the way you do and thats apparent. He wouldnt use someones stutter as a means of invalidating someones credibility as you have shown in trying to say elons head is filled with secrets and lies or whatever. Also the quote you are referring to is suppose to be self reflectant as einstein intended it. And also is suppose to have to do with if you have an idea thats fuzzy in your head you have to better understand it to be able to explain it simply.And to be frank thats what elon musk is doing in his stuttering. He wants to ensure he has a profound understanding of what he is thinking of, trying to say and how he is trying to convey it to a group of people who need to hear things a certain way to even build a remote understanding of things. It shows a lot of consideration.The people you are conveying are people like you or just the generalized human being who tend to have destructive mindsets that come with institutionalized thinking ... you know the people who build walls and not bridges. Not every person standardizes themselves to fit in society and something that all the greatest minds throughout history share a commonality in is that they go beyond just standardized modes of thinking aka just memorizing institutions and not ACTUALLY thinking. They spend every second constructively thinking of how to solve problems whether the problem be how they put out their message or how to produce quality products etc.Im certain you wont understand what im saying and will twist what im saying to fit something you already have preconcieved in your head. Which shows you are proving what im saying correct. You arent actually thinking you are doing the generalized thing.",4 years ago (edited),2
@matthewcuriel991," @matthewcuriel991  I understand very well, though I question if you do.

Sorry you couldn't just accept that I have an opinion different than yours.  I was hoping to simply spark a debate, not get personal.",4 years ago,2
@MiamiRyu," @jjmonns  i just have a passion for getting people to dig a little deeper in their thought processes most things in life are way more than you tend to see it... nothing you said hurt my feelings it just triggered a need for response. And if anything catalyzed me to respond its less of how much my feelings got hurt and more because i truly dont want your perspective to manifest because its the furthest thing from truth and people tend to adhere to the toxic realist points of view because thats how they view the constructed reality we have been built by those before us. And just you assuming that happens for most cases due to what typically happens to a person of higher status and recognition or whatever your reasoning may be in regards to why elon musk specifically would have any reason to convey such a negative agenda as you propose doesnt have corelation. I say this because you had mentioned something about his priveledges and in saying he has always had all his life and gets by using his workers where i felt that there is no way of you knowing that to be true any more than you wanting that to be true so you can say you knew something all along (its like the social media affect). All you have shown to me is that you rather take away peoples credibility with remarks that are twist on logical reasoning. Because to me you would be right if he was your average thinker because usually the generalized people are the easiest to find and understand their tendancies because they literally live life to be more predictable and to simplify what is supposed to be complex, but if you think different from the norms its hard to expect a generalized thinker to fully understand your intentions unless they open their minds to what you have to offer which doesnt happen a lot because people build mind walls in the face of conflicting ideas. They dont roll with the punchs they kinda just avoid getting hit by things they dont get.Think more optimistic of people dont think worst case scenario although worst case can be true and tends to be true amongst the generalized institutionalized majority from my observation, i can garuntee especially in a case where someone thinks beyond the institutionalized normz, that they are less inclined to do the ordinary thing in using their workers or thinking advantageously like that with their minds encompassing this notioned of having ""secrets and lies"" all because their mindset doesnt match your perspective ... you should instead of thinking rebuttal think of probable reasons to why a person may concieve ideas outside the norm cuz most the time there are good reasons to acknowledge if all you know are bad ones you can always dig a little deeper. Instead of demonizing a person you dont know entirely because his mindset on how society should be doesnt seem practical to you, try to build an understanding a bridge that connects what you have understood and connect it to what you can further understand. Im getting this point from when you said something about how his messages set people up for failure or something to that affect ... and you corelated it to his perspective. To me it showed you only walled out any possibility of his thinking having substance and truth. Almost emulating you have a better understanding of something that you have basically thought less about instead of just plainly noting you dont get it. If someone has a new idea it already shows they have thought in a different spot than you innately would have thought, so try to understand why it could be and not why it cant. If you cant understand why, thats all that can be known is that you cant understand not that their is nothing to understand. That person just has to do better at conveying his point . There is only nothing to understand when there is evidence of fallacy beyond reasonable doubt to blatantly dispose of the ideas.  Also stop trying to sense emotion through a typed out message because i can garuntee to you your emotion detectors are wrong in this case lol and to me it seems like just another bold claim to take away from my points. But i guess you will want to not take my word on that but its the truth ... im just passionate and if imma be a bit honest anger may fuel me but its anger towards knowing how humanity could be different for the better considering this perpetual toxicity is very terrible means yo have to live for all of human existance and how bad i want to have a positive affect on others hoping they allow themselves to hear me out. Thats my anger is hoping i can have an impact on people who wouldnt typically want to listen to a person who is a calculated idealist which tends to be a large amount of people in most cases. But apart from that im at peace im okay with how things are beyond my visions of how things should be, it is what it is at the end. I just let my passion to get a message across take over. And thats the intensity you get from my essay responses xD sorry for the length i just have to get my full intentions across.At the end im not trying to piss you off or make you seem terrible or whatever you might propogate from my responses; and although you doing those things still may happen, my intentions are just to catalyze a shift in your perspective is all because as sure as you had presented yourself you can never be too sure especially when a lot of what you said were twists on things that had different intentions to aid your points. The idea is i give your mind a different scope if you wanna take it or leave it that is on you. I dont feel like forcing you to change (plus forcing is inaffective) because at the end thats why they call it influencing people, the intention is you change without pressure or force.

This seems unbelievably impractical to have sleds for tens of thousands of vehicles in 12' tubes. Just from a psychological standpoint, I would never get into those tiny underground graves. How many vehicle elevators are we going to require and at what maintenance cost? How much money will it take to provide energy for moving thousands of vehicles that fast on sleds, where no car is contributing its own energy? Is he really planning on going thousands of feet deep with multiple levels and no emergency access? What is the geothermal temperature deep under LA?

Or something like that.Put it to you this way. Anyone who makes a company that is an expert in exploding rockets... and then decides to empty all of his life earnings into 1 more go.... and then says that he would be willing to ride on a future rocket... to mars.... is a good human. Way better than a lot of others at least.Good luck to him.P.S. The Idol worship of him is sorta creepy though. I see it a lot on YT comments and it's weird when anyone does that to someone.

Its in that sense that I call it un-critical. But is is also the interviewer who, instead of probing Musk's vision through intelligent questioning to really advance the discusion (after all he is supposed to be talking about the future of the world), chose to become almost a sidekick for Elon to advertise himself and his arrogant ego.",4 years ago,

@tomlam5241,"I mean, the hype is what makes Musk so awesome. Is he the world's best engineer? Probably not. But he IS one of the world's most famous engineers. Space exploration has been dead for decades since NASA's administrative blunders resulted in several lost lives, billions of dollars in losses, and a global distrust in engineering. We don't have a colony on mars because nobody wants one. As a huge fan who shares much the same vision as Musk, I hope he succeeds in building hype for mars, space, renewable energy, etc. If he accomplishes nothing else, but still that, you might as well reward him a peace prize and call him the greatest ever... because building hype for that is the catalyst for accomplishing radically new things. Without it, nothing new could be done.Who is the world's best engineer? He's probably only known by those who know him personally. An ideal engineer doesn't waste time building a public image, when they could be spending that time doing actual engineering. The person best able to do engineering might not even be an engineer. The best person doing engineering is... well... doing engineering. Follow the money, and you'll figure it out... but none of those people can build hype like Musk can. Without that hype, we'd never return to space... we were doing a great job at not returning to space the past few decades...And to be honest, Musk has achieved a fair bit with his reusable rocket design. Props to him... re-usability was conceived of and attempted decades before. It just failed. If he actually achieves the dreams he dreams... well, that's kind of a bonus. The fact that he gave us those dreams is the most important thing... because without that... we'll still be on Earth hundreds of years from now, waiting for someone to give us the dream to leave.",6 years ago,11

I believe that launching your career on a smaller, focused push of innovation like PayPal is key to encourage future success. PayPal sold for around 300 million, which means he made a fortune on his 1) innovative thinking that many others have and 2) his ambition which most of those innovative thinkers lack.

Lately it's been advancing so much because companies see profit and go down the easiest route to increase profit margins and keep investors happy. Elon invests into new risky territories because he wants humanity to advance.He could easily have created an incredible team and system and created a cool smartphone that puts Apple out of business. But he didnt do that, he went into uncharted territory and made it work.Also he is actually crazy smart, and a genuine nice guy most of the time (Everybody has flaws).

@grthorn3461,"I live in Poland, where our goverment changed education system to the worst - they just throw away middle school (gimnazjum, 3 years between primary school and higb school) and give us 8 years of primary school and 4/5 years of high school (we have 3 types of high school, so it can be 4 or 5 years long in these days system. I'm still in an old system, so I can go for 3-4 years). Schools are full of kids, they change classroom all the time, program and books are written in very short amount of time. This haven't change anything. I read about Finnish education system, some articles and stuff, my friend is now in Chile, so I asked her what she learns in history class in totally diffrent country. In Poland we learn about European/World history and about Polish history, a lot about WWII, similar thing with literature. On language lessons we learn grammar, not speaking, not using language. My dream is to make everyday language classes, where children will have opportunity to talk to kids from other schools and kids from other schools are actually learning your native language too, so it's win win situation. You can be good at math or art, but in adult life language is something very universal. We need more problem-solving, more democracy in class and responsibility for kids, then they'll understand that they learn for themselves (Sumerhill is great example), much less homework - kids need to be fascinated by teacher and want to learn more themselves. I also talked to my friend month ago. He said, that he really want to do something creative after school, but after 8-9 hours in class everything he wants is good youtube videos and chill. Kids and teens aren't actually stupid - nobody show them beauty of knowlege.This idea just blow in my mind few days ago, but it was somewere in my head for a long time. Education is actually real base of good, developing country and I was terrified, when after few minutes of googling I found a lot information what is wrong with education system, but nobody does something with this knowlege.I hope my grammar isn't spoiling this comment.",6 years ago,3
@than217,"Yup. I know about most changes that would improve our efficiency in a learning environment. Just asked Vanessa about it because you don't see a lot of people doing something to significantly change the system. Ideas are good for now but we're going to have to implement them somehow. It's interesting to peek into the minds of people that are striving towards the change. Vanessa just wrote a well known idea for change but isn't actually doing anything so I didn't bother with responding.

Where students from Age 5 - Age 18 explore at their own pace, and learn what they wish to learn, when they want to learn.  You must be Elon Musk's sister, because that's what he was talking about. Why are we on this earth? Don't we want to make it a far better place?  We have the internet and all the technology and apps and devices to where the students don't need teachers, but have leaders instead, that take care of health and safety issues. I understand you are still a student. Well, I'm at the other end of the scale. I am in my 60's and since the internet I am on an incredible learning journey. In fact there are two things I really love about Poland. They have an awesome games site called Play OK and a crytocurrency exchange called Bitbay. I look back on my years at school and I am thankful that I can read, write and have a working knowledge of the sciences. I think its ok to be at school from Age 5 - 12, to encourage accepted social behaviour and encourage sports activities as well as explore the arts and electronic technology. By age 13 - I think this is the time to explore life and its realities - the history of money, taxes, cultures, science, and especially computer science and why do we need to have certificates of learning now? Cryptocurrency is either run on blockchain technology which is a ledger account that can be used to store your knowledge of learning, or run on smart contract protocols where you have a contract with an online open sourced education facility.

But when Exxon Mobil does hellish things to this planet nobody notices it and no media outlet discusses it.

@BladeTheSuperior,what happens if Humans come to the conclusion that it is not possible to live on mars and get there as a human bc we were not ment to live there and it takes another 100 + yrs of dicking around with how to do it and they still cann't. It would then be all bc its not possible or it is but living there is a death sentence bc you cann't get back or grow anything which is all true rn cann't get there in human bodies or live there. Then this video is just about someone dream and not really reality. Plus the whole letting our kids decide to suiside themselves to mars is the most moronic idea I have heard in years.

@americanengineering2063,also if you beleive in bible it clearly says jesus will come back to earth not another place outside of earth and land in Jerusilum so if that is acctually true then all this means is humans will never carry out the mars mission and it will be a waste of our time stuck on the idea of one day it will work.

The doctors were planning on doing brain surgery on me because of my epilepsy, I refused because of the possible side effects.If I accepted brain surgery I could of forgotten all I had learnt during the entire decade before the surgery, still have partial seizures, have persistent strokes and even a 1% possibility of death.All brain surgery has the possibility of death, what percentage depends on knowledge and what the surgery's for. Elon only possesses information of a neurotypical brain, he has no idea how damaged brains, neurodivergent brains and people with other conditions will react.",3 years ago,

@liewkahmeng8459, @anujshukla5847  i don't think you understand space travel.It is simply impossible to travel at the speed of light never mind 100's of times faster needed to travel across the voids of space.We may have gone to the moon but technically that is still within the confines of Earths atmosphere.What Musk and others are doing is stroking their ego's.The only reason to go to Mars is pure publicity (and a good chance of the idiots trying it not coming back)To travel through space you would need to either create a wormhole (more power than in the whole universe needed to create one) or being able to bend/warp space time.You would also need artificial gravity.The human body is not constructed to live in space either so the longer your in space your heart shrinks.Good luck to anyone thinking they are travelling across the universe as it will never ever happen,3 years ago,

@captainvoluntaryistthestat3207," @CenTralAct  NASA can't do anything. They need to go through a lot of paper just to build a single rocket and that single handedly increases the cost and time it needs to build a rocket. Also NASA works with several other companies to build a rocket while SpaceX builds it all alone. NASA has to calculate to last penny because they need to say exact numbers to the goverment or they get nothing. In the meantime SpaceX literally blows rockets up. Now imagine NASA doing that: they build something from several companies with goverment money just to try it out and it does not work. What do they get? Less money. Period. They need to get everything perfect or they can't do anything. SpaceX does not have this problem. They are efficient in making rockets and testing them to see what is the max they can do.So NASA looks like they do nothing is because they really can't do anything with being 100% sure it is going to work. The cold war made this kinda lower because they wanted to win over the russians. But they won. Now they have nothing to do. If the USA caught wind that Russia is trying to make communist colonies on Mars, NASA would literally go there in 5 years and claim every little rock so the russians can't. In the meantime the USA goverment spends billions of dollars on the military just because they want to spread their freedom (which no one asked for tho). With that money (or at least a portion of it) given to NASA would cause a lot of rocketry to happen. Even now they are building new rockets (SLS) for a new project (Artemis program).And yes NASA does use SpaceX's rocket. It works, doesn't it? But they use Boing's new rocket too. Why? Because they want to give money to them. They don't need 100% to build a rocket. They can experiment with new technology and it is economically good for them too, not because they couldn't do it.",4 years ago,1

How do you think this is all going to play out? At the current rate of population growth it’s predicted that the world population will reach 12 billion by 2060. One problem. Most experts also agree that even considering foreseeable advancements in agricultural technology, as well as vast increases in agricultural land allocation, the Earth taps out around 11.5 billion for sustainable food production.

His statement may seem obvious and nonconsequential, but it's actually revolutionary.Humanities beliefs have always been dark and grim about the future, ask any older person what they think about the future and they will talk about the good old days and how we are entering scary times.  Many major religions point to an apocalypse; to most the future means death, destruction, poverty, disease, and darkness.  And humanity acts accordingly.  People live like the future should either not be thought about, or be thought about to warn of future demise. ""There is no hope in humanity, so I might as well do what I need to do for me and my family"".Elon was spot on with his diverging streams analogy.  If humanity believe that death and destruction are the sole heirs of the future, then we are choosing a stream that leads there.  But, Elon is trying to push the current to a new path.
